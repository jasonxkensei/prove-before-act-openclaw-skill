### POST /api/acp/checkout

### POST /api/acp/confirm

Confirm an ACP payment and issue the certification (see ACP section below).

## ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol)

AI agents can certify files without an API key by using the ACP payment flow over MultiversX.

### Flow

1. `POST /api/acp/checkout` — create a checkout session and get the EGLD transaction to send
2. Broadcast the transaction on MultiversX
3. `POST /api/acp/confirm` — submit the tx_hash to verify payment and receive the certification

### POST /api/acp/confirm — Retry Contract

When the MultiversX network is slow or temporarily unavailable, the confirm endpoint returns `402` with `retry: true` and guidance on how long to wait:

```json
{
  "error": "PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Could not reach the MultiversX network to verify payment...",
  "retry": true,
  "retry_after_seconds": 15,
  "max_retries": 5
}
```

**Retry guidelines for agent developers:**

- `retry: true` means the payment status is unknown — the transaction may be valid but the network is unreachable. Do **not** treat this as a final failure.
- `retry_after_seconds` (default `15`) — wait at least this many seconds before retrying.
- `max_retries` (default `5`) — after this many consecutive retries without success, stop and alert the user to check the transaction manually on the MultiversX explorer.
- `retry: false` (or field absent) — the payment was verified and rejected for a specific reason (wrong receiver, insufficient value, etc.). Retrying will not help; a new checkout is needed.

**Idempotency:** `POST /api/acp/confirm` is idempotent. If the checkout is already confirmed, re-submitting the same `checkout_id` returns `200` with the existing certification data instead of an error. This allows agents to retry safely after a network timeout without risk of double-billing.

### POST /mcp

MCP server endpoint. JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP.

Available tools: `certify_file`, `verify_proof`, `get_proof`, `discover_services`.
